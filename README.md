# mysql_8_docker_compose
My mysql 8 Docker Compose with native authentication enabled.
# Getting Started
To get started, you must have docker and docker-compose installed. Once installed, launch terminal and type:
```
  docker-compose up -d
```
and you will be good to go.

PS. Make sure you change the root password and the username password in the docker-compose file. If the second user fails to create, you can do this via mysql by directly accessing the docker container's bash.

Cheers!
